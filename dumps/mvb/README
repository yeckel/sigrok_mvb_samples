-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is set of example captures of the MVB data on a train data bus
taken from a single differential line. The data is a snipplet of a common 
communication running in a train.

Logic analyzer setup
--------------------

The logic analyzer used was a MCU123 Saleae Logic clone and a RS485 UART Adapter module from eBay.
